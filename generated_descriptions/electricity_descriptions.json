It contains strong, predictable daily and yearly seasonal patterns, with consumption levels fluctuating significantly based on the time of day and the season. These cyclical patterns, such as daytime peaks and nighttime troughs, make it ideal for short-term load forecasting and analyzing consumer behavior."
